# Grocery Analytics API

## Project Description

This MuleSoft API provides the back-end for an analytics dashboard. It leverages data from three sources: a relational database, an existing API, and a set of CSV files â€“ which detail orders, transactions, products, and customers. This project consumes, processes, and organizes this data to deliver a single RESTful API which the consumer can use to see different trends related to income, sales, and customers.

* Mulesoft - version 4.4.0
* Anypoint Studio - version 7.12.1
* JavaSE  1.8
* PostgreSQL
* Git
* AWS
* Spring Framework - version 2.6.7

## Features

- [x] Generate data results for total income per previous month, organized by Store ID, Product ID, and by day of the week.
